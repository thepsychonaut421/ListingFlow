  # Overview

ListingFlow is a middleware between ERPNext and e-commerce platforms like eBay and Shopify.
It imports products from ERPNext, processes and enriches the product data, and prepares them for publishing.
The system uses Genkit AI for:
	‚Ä¢	Category detection
	‚Ä¢	Description generation
	‚Ä¢	Technical specification extraction (brand, model, power, material, etc.)

	‚Ä¢	Import products from ERPNext
Synchronizes product list from ERPNext into ListingFlow.
	‚Ä¢	Product data enrichment
Enhances imported items with AI-generated descriptions and specifications.
	‚Ä¢	Automated category detection
Uses AI to determine the best-fit category for eBay listings.
	‚Ä¢	Technical specifications auto-extraction

	‚Ä¢	Export back to ERPNext
Updates the Description field in ERPNext with all enriched technical data.

‚öôÔ∏è Recommended Workflow
	1.	Import products from ERPNext using the Import from ERPNext feature.

   ERPNext Export Format

When exporting to ERPNext, ListingFlow formats the Description as:

[Original description]

Marke: [Brand]
Modell: [Model]
Leistung: [Power]
Kapazit√§t: [Capacity]
Material: [Material]
Max. Temperatur: [Max Temperature]
Spannung: [Voltage]
Ma√üe: [Dimensions]
Timer: [Timer range]
Gewicht: [Weight]

Funktionen:
[Comma-separated list of functions]

Zubeh√∂r:
[Comma-separated list of accessories]

üí° Note: If a brand is not pre-defined in ERPNext, it will still be included in the Description text, ensuring visibility without requiring ERPNext brand record creation.
