# Overview

**ListingFlow** is a middleware between **ERPNext** and e-commerce platforms like **eBay** and **Shopify**.  
It imports products from ERPNext, processes and enriches the product data, and prepares them for publishing.  
The system uses **Genkit AI** for:
- Category detection
- Description generation
- Technical specification extraction (brand, model, power, material, etc.)

## üöÄ Key Features
- **Import products from ERPNext** ‚Äì Synchronizes product list from ERPNext into ListingFlow.
- **Product data enrichment** ‚Äì Enhances imported items with AI-generated descriptions and specifications.
- **Automated category detection** ‚Äì Uses AI to determine the best-fit category for eBay listings.
- **Technical specifications auto-extraction** ‚Äì Extracts attributes like brand, model, power, capacity, material, dimensions, etc.
- **Export back to ERPNext** ‚Äì Updates the **Description** field in ERPNext with all enriched technical data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Recommended Workflow
1. **Import products** from ERPNext using the **Import from ERPNext** feature.
2. **Run the AI actions**:
   - Find Category
   - Generate Description
   - Find Technical Specs (brand, model, and other technical attributes)
3. **Review & adjust** extracted data inside the product form in ListingFlow.
4. **Export back to ERPNext** ‚Äî all technical specifications will be appended to the **Description** field.

## üì§ ERPNext Export Format

When exporting to ERPNext, ListingFlow formats the **Description** as:

```plaintext
[Original description]

Marke: [Brand]
Modell: [Model]
Leistung: [Power]
Kapazit√§t: [Capacity]
Material: [Material]
Max. Temperatur: [Max Temperature]
Spannung: [Voltage]
Ma√üe: [Dimensions]
Timer: [Timer range]
Gewicht: [Weight]

Funktionen:
[Comma-separated list of functions]

Zubeh√∂r:
[Comma-separated list of accessories]

üí° Note: If a brand is not pre-defined in ERPNext, it will still be included in the Description text, ensuring visibility without requiring ERPNext brand record creation.

  - variable: ERPNEXT_API_SECRET
    secret: ERPNEXT_API_SECRET
    availability:
      - BUILD
      - RUNTIME

After creating secrets, grant App Hosting access:

```bash
firebase apphosting:secrets:grantaccess ERPNEXT_API_KEY ERPNEXT_API_SECRET
```

	5.	Start the development server

npm run dev
