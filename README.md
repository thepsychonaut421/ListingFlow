## üõ† Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thepsychonaut421/ListingFlow.git
cd ListingFlow
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables for Local Development

Create a file named `.env.local` in the project root and add the following variables. These are essential for connecting to external services. Use the `.env` file as a template.

```env
# ERPNext Credentials
ERPNEXT_BASE_URL=https://erp.example.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_ERPNEXT_BASE_URL=https://erp.example.com
ERPNEXT_API_KEY=xxxxx
ERPNEXT_API_SECRET=xxxxx

# Shopify Credentials
SHOPIFY_STORE_URL="https://your-store-name.myshopify.com"
SHOPIFY_ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN="shpat_..."
```

### 4. Configure Deployment Secrets for Firebase App Hosting

When deploying to Firebase App Hosting, you must create secrets for your environment variables. **This is a mandatory step for the deployed app to function correctly.**

Run the following commands, replacing `your_value_here` with your actual credentials:

```bash
# Set secrets for ERPNext
firebase apphosting:secrets:set ERPNEXT_API_KEY
firebase apphosting:secrets:set ERPNEXT_API_SECRET

# Set secrets for Shopify
firebase apphosting:secrets:set SHOPIFY_STORE_URL
firebase apphosting:secrets:set SHOPIFY_ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN
```
*(You will be prompted to enter the secret value in your terminal after running each command.)*

After creating the secrets, **you must grant the App Hosting service account access to them**. This is a critical step.

```bash
firebase apphosting:secrets:grantaccess ERPNEXT_API_KEY ERPNEXT_API_SECRET SHOPIFY_STORE_URL SHOPIFY_ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

The `apphosting.yaml` file is already configured to use these secrets.

### 5. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```
